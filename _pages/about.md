I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Electrical Engineering at Louisiana State University (Expected 2027), advised in the area of **Motion Planning & Control** and **Reinforcement Learning**. My research focuses on developing intelligent algorithms for autonomous vehicles, including trajectory planning, motion control, and learning-based approaches.

Before joining LSU, I earned my M.S. in Mechanical Engineering from Florida Institute of Technology (2019) and both my M.E. and B.E. from Shijiazhuang Tiedao University, China (2020, 2016).

I also have industry experience as an ADAS Planning & Control Engineer at DESAY SV Automotive (2022–2023), where I developed motion planning and control algorithms for automatic parking systems deployed in production vehicles.

## Research Interests

- Motion Planning (Trajectory Optimization, Hybrid A\*, RRT\*)
- Motion Control (MPC, LQR, PID)
- Reinforcement Learning for Autonomous Driving
- Vehicle Dynamics & Kinematics

## News

- **2025** — Two papers accepted in *Transportation Research Record*
- **2024** — Paper accepted at MLCCIM 2024
